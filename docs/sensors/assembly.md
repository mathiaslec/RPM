# Assembly instructions

The PCB must be removed from the optical mouse first. Then the VDD, GND, SCK and SDIO pins must be soldered to wires leading to the microcontroller and its internal 5V power supply.

Insert the two M3 brass threaded inserts into the sensor holder by applying pressure. 
Attach the sensor to the sensor holder using 2 M3 screws.

The lens must be glued to the PCB in the correct position, with the lens aligned with the optical flow sensor.
